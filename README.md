# TurboRuntime
I am developing a stack virtual machine (just like the JVM). This project aims to create a lightweight, fast, easy to implement runtime that can run on various platforms, including the Web.

The idea is that anyone can create their own programming language and runtime using Turbo, and customizing it through the Turbo syscall.

It currently has an assembler, packager and a runtime. I am currently creating documentation, it will soon be available for anyone interested.
